		<h2>Why does this exist?</h2>
		<p class="padding">
			This learning package is here to help you learn C++, the primary programming language for several modules in Abertay University. If you are joining one of our courses then we can assume you have some grasp of programming in general, either with Java or C#. This package will introduce you to the basics of C++ and cover some simple examples of converting Java/C# programs. If you are using this website and have NO knowledge of programming, then you would be better off looking into tutorials that start from the beginning.<br />
			This learning package is for Direct Entrant students to help with understanding the basics of the C++ programming language. A number of modules at Abertay are designed around using this language so an understanding of how it works and how to program with it will be essential in your studies. In the past Direct Entrants usually have some programming experience, with Java and C# being the most common ones, so this package will also cover the conversion of these languages into C++ alternatives.<br />
			We will cover the following topics over the course of this package:
		</p>
		<ul class="normal">
			<li>Visual Studio Project Creation</li>
			<li>Introduction to C++</li>
			<li>Creating Variables</li>
			<li>Loops and Statements</li>
			<li>Functions</li>
			<li>Classes</li>
			<li>Introduction to Header Files</li>
			<li>C++ Memory Management</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="padding">
			After we have covered these topics we will have an exercise to allow you to see how a Java/C# project can be converted into C++, and finally we will give you a problem to solve and program a solution for.<br /><br />
			By the time you finish the package you should have learned how to create and structure a C++ program, how to program a basic console application, and how to produce a solution to a problem using C++.<br /><br />
			Prerequisites: <br />
			&emsp;&emsp;C++ compiler. I recommend <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio 2017</a>.<br /><br /><br />
			Look into <a href="OTHERRESOURCES.html">Other Resources</a> for some online tutorials and recommended books.
